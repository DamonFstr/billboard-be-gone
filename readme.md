### What is it?
It's a Chrome extension to block that really annoying auto-playing banner on the index page of Netflix.

I probably won't maintain this a whole lot, so I'm not too bothered about uploading it to the Chrome web store. So you'll need to clone/download this repo and then [manually install the extension](https://www.howtogeek.com/233355/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store-and-firefox-add-ons-gallery/).

It will fill your Javascript console up with errors like this, so don't worry about that:
